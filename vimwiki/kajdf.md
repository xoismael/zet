# Takeaways from Nagli interview 

- A lot of his automation depends on bash (while, for loops...) 
  
He sent his full automation to justin. Justin recommended that there is no message broker in the automation. A message broker is a software that enables communication between different systems, services or even applications. It is done in a way where each service is subscribed to the message broker and then they wait for some message to be received from the message broker in order to perform their assigned task. The message broker acts as intermediary so that the systems are able to exchange informations and do their tasks.

- Log4J was a turning point for him.
- CS-253 web-security course that he took from staford.
- he barely does manual hacking.
- He finds it difficult to automate anything related to endpoints.
