# Searching for vulnerable code snippets in JS files

The most widely used js library by far is jquery. And a lot of vulnerabilities are associated with it. There are also other library that are vulnerable. So my goal here is to collect the JS files associated with the specific company and searching for vulnerable snippet codes across the files. Simple as that. To automate the process of doing this, I will be using nuclei, which is a powerful tool to do this.
